        <h1>How Oskar tracks happiness in your team</h1>
        <p class="product_description">Oskar has only one single task, but he tackles it dutfilly. Once per day he'll ask your team mates on Slack how they're doing.</p>
        <p>He is easy to satisfy but can be quite persistent if you don't reply. That's because he takes his job seriously (like all of his non-squirrel team mates) and wants to make sure that everyone on the team is OK.
