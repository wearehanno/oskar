  introduction: "Hey {0}! Let me quickly introduce myself.\nMy name is Oskar, and the team has drafted me in to be their new happiness coach on Slack. I'm not going to bother you a lot, but every once in a while (usually twice a day), I'm gonna ask how you feel. Ready? *Just reply to this message and we'll give is a try* :smile:"

  firstMessage: "Alright! From now on, I'll check in once in a while to ask how you're feeling?'\n\nYou can reply to me with a number between 1 and 5, and I'll keep track of your answers over time and share them with your team.\n\nOK? Let's give it a try: *How do you feel right now?*\n
          (5) :heart_eyes_cat: Awesome\n
          (4) :smile: Really good\n
